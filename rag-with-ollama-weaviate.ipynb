This representation captures high-level semantic information from the document and can be used for various applications such as text classification, document clustering, and information retrieval.\\n\\nThe idea behind Ref2vec is to create a vector that represents each word in a document by taking the average of its representations in the context of all other words in the same document. This way, the representation of a document becomes more informative because it captures not only the individual words but also their relationships and co-occurrence patterns.\\n\\nFor example, consider the following sentence: \\\"The elephant is an African animal.\\\" In the vector space generated by Ref2vec, this sentence will be represented as a point in high dimensional space that takes into account the semantic meaning of each word and its context in relation to other words. This representation can then be used for various downstream tasks such as text classification or document clustering.\\n\"\n",
